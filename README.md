# Clean-Water
Nearly 1,000 children under age 5 die every day from diarrhea caused by contaminated water, poor sanitation, and unsafe hygiene.
But we believe the global water and sanitation crisis can be solved within our lifetimes. That’s why we’re focused on providing clean water and sanitation to every person in every community we work in, including the most vulnerable populations in the hardest-to-reach places. 
This work is more important now than ever, since clean water is essential for handwashing and disinfection to prevent the spread of diseases like COVID-19.
